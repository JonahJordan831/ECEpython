    "a subroutine operates on data. \n",
    "The difference is subtle but important. \n",

    "More recent thinking has functions being able to operate on data (they always could) and the value returned may be simply an exit code.\n",
    "An analogy are the functions in *MS Excel*. \n",

    "\n",
    "Some functions expect us to pass data to them to perform their tasks. \n",
    "These data are known as parameters( older terminology is arguments, or argument list) and we pass them to the function by enclosing their values in parenthesis ( ) separated by commas. \n",
